# gift the code hackathon

## October 21-23

This is a Volunteer Management created for PFLAG tool focused on organizing and engaging volunteers. We took this one step further by analyzing the applications data and user activity in order to view statistics and understand their user/volunteer engagement. Volunteers and Administrators can create their own user profiles where they can share their stories and  reach out to one another. There is an events calendar which allows users to see what the charity is doing and schedule their participation by notifying that they will be attending events. This feature will help with scheduling volunteers and maintaining their engagement through notifications for upcoming events by email.
